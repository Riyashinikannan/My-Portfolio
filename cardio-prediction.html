              <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>The Cardiovascular Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based solution designed to predict the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in individuals. 
                CVDs, such as heart attacks and strokes, are leading causes of death worldwide, often arising from risk factors like high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, smoking, and an unhealthy lifestyle. 
                Early prediction of these diseases is crucial for timely intervention and better patient outcomes.
                The system aims to analyze patient data, including clinical parameters and lifestyle factors, to estimate the likelihood of developing cardiovascular conditions. This assists healthcare providers in proactive decision-making and personalized care planning.
